# 📊 Nexus DataLens – Cloud-Native Automated Data Analytics Pipeline

Nexus DataLens is a serverless, end-to-end automated data analytics pipeline built on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
It helps businesses and data professionals transform raw, unstructured CSV files into clean, structured insights without manual effort or deep technical expertise.

Through a simple web interface, users upload raw data, and the system autonomously executes the pipeline: ingestion, cleaning, cataloging, and visualization — accelerating data-to-decision workflows in a secure, scalable, and cost-effective way.

🌍 Project Overview

Data analytics often requires time-consuming manual processing before insights can be generated.
Nexus DataLens automates this by enabling:

Easy CSV upload via a web interface

Data cleaning & preparation with AWS Glue DataBrew

Schema cataloging using AWS Glue Crawlers & Data Catalog

Visualization in Amazon QuickSight or Power BI

Scalable & serverless architecture for low-cost analytics

This project demonstrates the power of AWS serverless and event-driven architectures for modern data engineering.

✨ Features

✅ Simple CSV upload through a web interface
✅ Automated data cleaning & transformation with Glue DataBrew
✅ Schema detection & metadata cataloging via Glue Crawlers
✅ Ready-to-use dashboards in QuickSight / Power BI
✅ Secure, scalable, and fully serverless backend
✅ Automated pipeline triggered on file upload
✅ Cost-efficient, pay-as-you-go cloud solution

🏗 Architecture

Architecture Flow

User uploads CSV via web interface → stored in Amazon S3

AWS Lambda triggers Glue DataBrew job for cleaning

Glue Crawlers update schema in Glue Data Catalog

Data made query-ready for QuickSight / Power BI dashboards

AWS Services Used:

Amazon S3 – Data lake for raw CSV storage

AWS Lambda – Serverless orchestration & triggers

AWS Glue DataBrew – Data cleaning & transformation

AWS Glue Crawlers & Data Catalog – Schema cataloging

Amazon QuickSight / Power BI – Visualization layer

Amazon CloudFront + S3 – Hosting for web interface

AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild – CI/CD automation

AWS CloudFormation – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

⚙ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js (AWS Lambda)
